pyBHT

pyBHT is a model code which calculates formation temperature from time
series of three or more bottom hole temperatures recorded at the same
depth. The model simulates the cooling as a result of drilling and the
subsequent thermal recovery. The forward solution is calculated using a
2D explicit finite difference solver of the heat flow equation. 
Formation and borehole temperature are estimated using the downhill
simplex algorithm provided by Scipy.


Usage
- Adjust the location of the BHT input file and the model parameters in
  the model parameter file: pyBHT_params.py
- Adjust the BHT series input data. An example file is located in:
  /input/BHT.csv
- Run the model: python pyBHT.py
- A .csv file that contains the model results, including the calibrated
  formation temperatures is stored in the folder /results/
- A figure of the model results is created automatically and stored
   in the folder /fig/


Prerequisites
pyBHT requires the following python packages:
- numpy
- scipy
- matplotlib
